## Overview - The users App

The "Users" app is a Django application designed for user management and user-related features. It includes functionalities such as user registration, user profiles, user relationships (followers and following), and user authentication using [Django Rest Knox](https://jazzband.github.io/django-rest-knox/). This documentation provides a detailed guide on how to use the "Users" app and its API endpoints.

## Installation

Before using the "Users" app, you need to set it up in your Django project. Here are the steps for installation:

1. Clone the project repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yasu-Fadhili/knox_auth.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd knox_auth
```

3. Install the required Python packages using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run migrations to create the app's database tables:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

5. Run the development server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The "Users" app is now installed and ready to use.

## Project Structure

Before setting up the project, make sure you have a basic understanding of its structure. The structure typically includes directories and files such as:

- `manage.py` - The Django management script.
- `yourproject/` - The main project directory.
  - `settings.py` - Django project settings.
  - `urls.py` - URL configuration.
  - `apps/` - Application directories.
  - `templates/` - HTML templates.
  - `static/` - Static files (CSS, JavaScript, etc.).
  - `requirements.txt` - Python package dependencies.

## Project Setup

1. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   - If not already installed, install virtualenv:
     ```shell
     pip install virtualenv
     ```
   - Create a virtual environment for your project:
     ```shell
     virtualenv venv
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - On Windows:
       ```shell
       venv\Scripts\activate
       ```
     - On macOS and Linux:
       ```shell
       source venv/bin/activate
       ```
2. **Install Django and Required Packages:**
   - Install Django and other necessary packages in your virtual environment:
     ```shell
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Create a Django Project:**
   - Create a new Django project using the following command:
     ```shell
     django-admin startproject yourproject
     ```

## Django Settings

1. **Configure Installed Apps:**
   - In `yourproject/settings.py`, add the following apps to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list:
     ```python
     INSTALLED_APPS = [
         # ...
         'rest_framework',
         'knox',
         'django_countries',
     ]
     ```

2. **Database Configuration:**
   - Configure your database settings in the `DATABASES` section of `settings.py`.
   - For example, you can use SQLite for development:
     ```python
     DATABASES = {
         'default': {
             'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
             'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
         }
     }
     ```

3. **Django Rest Framework and Knox:**
   - Configure Django Rest Framework and Knox settings:
     ```python
     REST_FRAMEWORK = {
         'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': [
             'knox.auth.TokenAuthentication',
         ],
     }

     AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES = (
         'knox.auth.TokenAuthentication',
     )

     AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'users.User'  # Replace 'users' with your user app's name
     ```

4. **Internationalisation and Localisation:**
   - Configure the use of [Django Countries](https://github.com/SmileyChris/django-countries) and localisation in `settings.py`:
     ```python
     COUNTRIES_OVERRIDE = {
         'UK': 'United Kingdom',
     }

     LANGUAGE_CODE = 'en-gb'
     TIME_ZONE = 'UTC'
     USE_I18N = True
     USE_L10N = True
     USE_TZ = True
     ```

   - Refer to [Django Countries](https://github.com/SmileyChris/django-countries) for More 


## URL Configuration

1. **Create URL Patterns:**
   - In `yourproject/urls.py`, create URL patterns for your project. For example:
     ```python
     from django.contrib import admin
     from django.urls import path, include

     urlpatterns = [
         path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
         path('users/', include('users.urls')),  # Include your app's URLs here
     ]
     ```



The "Users" app is structured as follows:

- `users/` - The main app directory.
- `__init__.py` - Initiates the users directory as a module
- `admin.py` - Defines the app's admin interface.
- `apps.py` - .
- `forms.py` - .
- `managers.py` - .
- `signals.py` - Handles the auto creation of Profile adn Profile Status on User creation.
- `tests.py` - .
- `models.py` - Defines the app's data models.
- `serializers.py` - Contains serializers for data serialization.
- `views.py` - Includes views for handling HTTP requests.
- `urls.py` - Configures URL routing for the app.
